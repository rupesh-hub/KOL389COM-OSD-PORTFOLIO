Yatzy Game - Issues Report
==========================

Last Updated: April 4, 2025

1. Scoring Accuracy
-------------------
- Some edge cases in scoring combinations (e.g. Full House with repeated numbers) need further testing.
- Upper section bonus logic not yet verified with multiple roll scenarios.

2. Input Validation
-------------------
- Currently minimal error handling for invalid player input (e.g. entering letters instead of numbers).
- Need stricter validation for category selection.

3. Game Flow
------------
- No option to restart the game once it's finished.
- No support for multiplayer mode yet (currently assumes single player or hot-seat play).

4. UI/UX (if applicable)
------------------------
- Terminal interface can be improved for better readability.
- Future plan: Consider adding a graphical interface using tkinter or a web version.

5. Code Structure
-----------------
- Some functions in the Yatzy class are too long and could be refactored for clarity.
- Could benefit from more unit tests to ensure scoring logic works across all categories.

6. Future Improvements
----------------------
- Add save/load game functionality.
- Implement AI opponent.
- Enhance scoreboard to display current rankings and total scores.
