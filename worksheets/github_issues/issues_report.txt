Debug Notes: Fixing the full_house() Method
🔍 How the Bug Was Identified (by friend):
👀 My friend noticed that the full_house() method returned a non-zero score even for invalid combinations like [6, 6, 6, 4, 5], which is not a full house.

🧠 They realized the method was too lenient — it only checked if the sorted counts were [1, 1, 3].

🗣 They pointed out that a valid full house must have exactly one three-of-a-kind and one pair, nothing else.

🛠 How I Resolved It:
✅ Rewrote the logic to specifically check:

There must be exactly two distinct counts.

One value must appear three times, another two times.

💡 Used Counter to get dice frequencies and applied a strict 3 in counts and 2 in counts and len(counts) == 2 condition.

🧪 Retested with various valid and invalid full house cases to ensure correctness.

💬 Added a comment to make the correct logic clearer for future readers.


Yatzy Game - Issues Report
==========================

Last Updated: April 4, 2025

1. Scoring Accuracy
-------------------
- Some edge cases in scoring combinations (e.g. Full House with repeated numbers) need further testing.
- Upper section bonus logic not yet verified with multiple roll scenarios.

2. Input Validation
-------------------
- Currently minimal error handling for invalid player input (e.g. entering letters instead of numbers).
- Need stricter validation for category selection.

3. Game Flow
------------
- No option to restart the game once it's finished.
- No support for multiplayer mode yet (currently assumes single player or hot-seat play).

4. UI/UX (if applicable)
------------------------
- Terminal interface can be improved for better readability.
- Future plan: Consider adding a graphical interface using tkinter or a web version.

5. Code Structure
-----------------
- Some functions in the Yatzy class are too long and could be refactored for clarity.
- Could benefit from more unit tests to ensure scoring logic works across all categories.

6. Future Improvements
----------------------
- Add save/load game functionality.
- Implement AI opponent.
- Enhance scoreboard to display current rankings and total scores.
